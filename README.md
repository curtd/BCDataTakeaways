Job tips/notes from the BC Data Science Workshop

- have projects under your belt (through your degree or on your own) and be able to communicate them effectively
- communication is key
- having a github repository is very favourable (language of projects not always relevant)
- knowing python is important for day to day work (at Amazon), but knowing multiple languages isn't always super relevant
- you'll have to learn a lot of things on your own on the job, especially coming from a pure scientific computing background
- work on obtaining the skills outlined below BEFORE you graduate and you'll be in a lot nicer position upon graduation
- knowing about optimization is a big advantage - don't neglect it
- useful free resources
